# Grade 4 Math Lesson: Introduction to Fractions

## Objective
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand what fractions are.
- Identify fractions in visual representations.
- Compare simple fractions.

## 1. What is a Fraction?
A **fraction** shows a part of a whole.  
It has two numbers:
- **Top number (numerator)**: How many parts we have.
- **Bottom number (denominator)**: How many equal parts in total.

Example:  
\[
\frac{1}{2} \quad \text{means 1 part out of 2 equal parts}
\]

---

## 2. Visual Example
Imagine a pizza cut into **4 equal slices**:  
- If you eat **1 slice**, you have eaten **1/4** of the pizza.  
- If you eat **2 slices**, you have eaten **2/4** of the pizza.

---

## 3. Comparing Fractions
When the denominators are the same:
- The bigger the numerator, the bigger the fraction.  

Example:  
\[
\frac{3}{4} > \frac{1}{4}
\]

## 4. Practice Questions
1. Draw a circle and shade **1/3** of it.
2. Which is bigger: **2/5** or **4/5**?
3. If a chocolate bar is cut into **8 pieces** and you eat **3 pieces**, what fraction of the bar did you eat?

---

## Homework
- Find 3 examples of fractions in your home (e.g., 1/2 a cup of sugar, 1/4 of a pizza, 3/8 of a chocolate bar).
- Write them down and draw a picture for each.
